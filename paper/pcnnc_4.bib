	abstract = {Our brains have evolved the ability to configure and adapt their processing states to match the unique challenges of acting and learning in diverse environments and behavioral contexts. In biological nervous systems, such state specification and adaptation arise in part from neuromodulators, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine, whose diffuse release fine-tunes neuronal and synaptic dynamics and plasticity to complement the behavioral context in real-time. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of deep neural networks for specific tasks, they remain relatively inflexible at generalizing across tasks or adapting to ever-changing behavioral demands. In this article, we provide an overview of neuromodulatory systems and their relationship to emerging pertinent principles in deep neural networks. We further outline opportunities for the integration of neuromodulatory principles into deep neural networks, towards endowing artificial intelligence with a key ingredient underlying the flexibility and learning capability of biological systems.},

A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here, we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.},

              How do synaptic or other neuronal changes support learning? This subject has been dominated by Hebb's postulate of synaptic change.

              Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca
              2+
              ) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.},

Evidence for high-capacity storage in the hippocampus is missing, however. When animals are tested in pairs of environments, different combinations of place cells are recruited, consistent with the notion of independent representations. However, the extent to which representations remain independent across larger numbers of environments has not been determined. To investigate whether spatial firing patterns recur when animals are exposed to multiple environments, we tested rats in 11 recording boxes, each in a different room, allowing for 55 comparisons of place maps in each animal. In each environment, activity was recorded from neuronal ensembles in hippocampal area CA3, with an average of 30 active cells per animal. Representations were highly correlated between repeated tests in the same room but remained orthogonal across all combinations of different rooms, with minimal overlap in the active cell samples from each environment. A low proportion of cells had activity in many rooms but the firing locations of these cells were completely uncorrelated. Taken together, the results suggest that the number of independent spatial representations stored in hippocampal area CA3 is large, with minimal recurrence of spatial firing patterns across environments.},

LEC neurons perform important functions for episodic memory processing, coding for contextually salient elements of an environment or experience. However, we know little about the functional circuit interactions between the LEC and the hippocampus. We combine functional circuit mapping and computational modeling to examine how long-range glutamatergic LEC projections modulate compartment-specific excitation-inhibition dynamics in hippocampal area CA1. We demonstrate that glutamatergic LEC inputs can drive local dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons, aided by the recruitment of a disinhibitory VIP interneuron microcircuit. Our circuit mapping and modeling further reveal that LEC inputs also recruit CCK interneurons that may act as strong suppressors of dendritic spikes. These results highlight a cortically driven GABAergic microcircuit mechanism that gates nonlinear dendritic computations, which may support compartment-specific coding of multisensory contextual features within the hippocampus.},

Tetrodes were implanted along the entire proximodistal axis of dorsal CA1 in rats. Data were recorded in cylinders large enough to elicit firing at more than one location in many neurons. Distal CA1 cells showed more dispersed firing and had a larger number of firing fields than proximal cells. Phase-locking of spikes to MEC theta oscillations was weaker in distal CA1 than in proximal CA1. The findings suggest that spatial firing in CA1 is organized transversally, with the strongest spatial modulation occurring in the MEC-associated proximal part.},

	abstract = {Cholinergic inputs from the medial septum are projected to pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and release acetylcholine (ACh) from their terminals. The cholinergic inputs are considered to be integrated with sensory inputs and to play a crucial role in learning and memory. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the relative timing between pre- and post-synaptic spiking determines the direction and extent of synaptic changes in a critical temporal window, a process known as spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Positive timing where excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) precedes the postsynaptic action potential induces long-term potentiation (LTP) while negative timing where EPSP follows the action potential induces long-term depression (LTD). To investigate the influence of muscarinic activation by cholinergic inputs on synaptic plasticity, STDP-inducing stimuli were applied during the muscarinic induction of a slow EPSP followed by repetitive stimulation in the stratum oriens. As a result, LTP was facilitated and LTD was abolished by the muscarinic activation. Furthermore, interestingly, LTP was also facilitated and LTD was switched to LTP with an increase in ACh concentration following application of the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. These results indicate that the orientation of plasticity was shifted for potentiation by muscarinic activation. On the other hand, the application of excess ACh concentration completely suppressed STDP, LTP and LTD. In addition, STDP was suppressed in the presence of atropine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist. Taken together, the findings suggest that synaptic plasticity modulation depends on the amount of cholinergic inputs. The modulation of synaptic plasticity by muscarinic activation might be an important stage in the integration of top-down and bottom-up information in hippocampal CA1 neurons.},

Previously, we reported that dopamine, a reward signal, broadens the time window for synaptic potentiation and modulates the outcome of hippocampal STDP even when applied after the plasticity induction protocol (Brzosko et al., 2015). Here, we demonstrate that sequential neuromodulation of STDP by acetylcholine and dopamine offers an efficacious model of reward-based navigation. Specifically, our experimental data in mouse hippocampal slices show that acetylcholine biases STDP toward synaptic depression, whilst subsequent application of dopamine converts this depression into potentiation. Incorporating this bidirectional neuromodulation-enabled correlational synaptic learning rule into a computational model yields effective navigation toward changing reward locations, as in natural foraging behavior. Thus, temporally sequenced neuromodulation of STDP enables associations to be made between actions and outcomes and also provides a possible mechanism for aligning the time scales of cellular and behavioral learning., DOI:

The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.},

To that end, sensory networks in the brain must form object representations invariant to stimulus changes, such as size, orientation and context. Although Hebbian plasticity is known to shape sensory networks, it fails to create invariant object representations in computational models, raising the question of how the brain achieves such processing. In the present study, we show that combining Hebbian plasticity with a predictive form of plasticity leads to invariant representations in deep neural network models. We derive a local learning rule that generalizes to spiking neural networks and naturally accounts for several experimentally observed properties of synaptic plasticity, including metaplasticity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Finally, our model accurately captures neuronal selectivity changes observed in the primate inferotemporal cortex in response to altered visual experience. Thus, we provide a plausible normative theory emphasizing the importance of predictive plasticity mechanisms for successful representational learning.},

	abstract = {When animals encounter a new environment, their cells with spatially modulated activity such as place cells and grid cells remap. Grid cells are particular in their remapping in that populations coherently remap as observed in spacing, orientation and phase changes. This process points to generality in grid cell activity that forms a standard computation across environments, which many speculate is path integration. Recently, normative artificial neural network models have shown that path integration and grid-cell-like activity can be obtained in recurrent neural networks (RNN) trained to navigate in a simulated two-dimensional environment. Remarkably, the emergent spatial profile of these grid-like cells is similar to biological cell responses in that they set up a toroidal structure. However, these models have not yet been tested in multiple environments relative to biological remapping. In this work, we extend the RNN normative model to multiple environments, modelled with place cell global remapping. Through this perturbation, we show (i) that the model can navigate multiple environments, (ii) that putative grid cells remain biologically plausible, (iii) a mechanism of how grid cells may remap, and (iv) a discussion on generalisation with inertial navigation in the grid and place cell network.},

We argue that deviations from lattice symmetry are key for understanding grid-cell function. We propose three possible functions for grid cells, which treat real-world grid distortions as a feature rather than a bug. First, grid cells may constitute a local metric for proximal space rather than a global metric for all space. Second, grid cells could form a metric for subjective action-relevant space rather than physical space. Third, distortions may represent salient locations. Finally, we discuss mechanisms that can underlie these functions. These ideas may transform our thinking about grid cells.},

Neurons develop an organized recurrent architecture based on the similarity of their inputs, interacting through inhibitory interneurons. The mature network can convert velocity inputs into estimates of animal location, showing that spatially periodic responses and the capacity of path integration can arise through synaptic plasticity, acting on inputs that display neither. The model provides numerous predictions about the necessity of spatial exploration for grid cell development, network topography, the maturation of velocity tuning and neural correlations, the abrupt transition to stable patterned responses, and possible mechanisms to set grid period across grid modules.},

	abstract = {Animal navigation research posits that organisms build and maintain internal spatial representations, or maps, of their environment. We ask if machines -- specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) navigation agents -- also build implicit (or 'mental') maps. A positive answer to this question would (a) explain the surprising phenomenon in recent literature of ostensibly map-free neural-networks achieving strong performance, and (b) strengthen the evidence of mapping as a fundamental mechanism for navigation by intelligent embodied agents, whether they be biological or artificial. Unlike animal navigation, we can judiciously design the agent's perceptual system and control the learning paradigm to nullify alternative navigation mechanisms. Specifically, we train 'blind' agents -- with sensing limited to only egomotion and no other sensing of any kind -- to perform PointGoal navigation ('go to \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ x, \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ y') via reinforcement learning. Our agents are composed of navigation-agnostic components (fully-connected and recurrent neural networks), and our experimental setup provides no inductive bias towards mapping. Despite these harsh conditions, we find that blind agents are (1) surprisingly effective navigators in new environments ({\textasciitilde}95\% success); (2) they utilize memory over long horizons (remembering {\textasciitilde}1,000 steps of past experience in an episode); (3) this memory enables them to exhibit intelligent behavior (following walls, detecting collisions, taking shortcuts); (4) there is emergence of maps and collision detection neurons in the representations of the environment built by a blind agent as it navigates; and (5) the emergent maps are selective and task dependent (e.g. the agent 'forgets' exploratory detours). Overall, this paper presents no new techniques for the AI audience, but a surprising finding, an insight, and an explanation.},

Under the multiscale neuromodulatory framework, plastic components, dropout probability modulation, and learning rate decay were added to the single unit, layer, and whole network levels of DNN models, respectively.

Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3–5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex6. Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types12. We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments—optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.},

Here, we review recent research that brings this assumption into doubt. Instead, we propose that place cell spatial firing patterns are determined by environmental sensory inputs, including those representing the distance and direction to environmental boundaries, while grid cells provide a complementary self-motion related input that contributes to maintaining place cell firing. In this view, grid and place cell firing patterns are not successive stages of a processing hierarchy, but complementary and interacting representations that work in combination to support the reliable coding of large-scale space.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells are thought to form a representation of space by integrating internal and external sensory cues. Experimental studies show that different subsets of place cells are controlled by vision, self-motion or a combination of both. Moreover, recent studies in environments with a high degree of visual aliasing suggest that a continuous interaction between place cells and grid cells can result in a deformation of hexagonal grids or in a progressive loss of visual cue control. The computational nature of such a bidirectional interaction remains unclear. In this work we present a neural network model of a dynamic loop between place cells and grid cells. The model is tested in two recent experimental paradigms involving double-room environments that provide conflicting evidence about visual cue control over self-motion-based spatial codes. Analysis of the model behavior in the two experiments suggests that the strength of hippocampal-entorhinal dynamical loop is the key parameter governing differential cue control in multi-compartment environments. Construction of spatial representations in visually identical environments requires weak visual cue control, while synaptic plasticity is regulated by the mismatch between visual- and self-motion representations. More generally our results suggest a functional segregation between plastic and dynamic processes in hippocampal processing.},

        , The unitary firing fields of hippocampal place cells are commonly assumed to be generated by input from entorhinal grid cell modules with differing spatial scales. Here, we review recent research that brings this assumption into doubt. Instead, we propose that place cell spatial firing patterns are determined by environmental sensory inputs, including those representing the distance and direction to environmental boundaries, while grid cells provide a complementary self-motion related input that contributes to maintaining place cell firing. In this view, grid and place cell firing patterns are not successive stages of a processing hierarchy, but complementary and interacting representations that work in combination to support the reliable coding of large-scale space.},

	abstract = {While grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rodents have multiple, regularly arranged firing fields, place cells in the cornu ammonis (CA) regions of the hippocampus mostly have single spatial firing fields. Since there are extensive projections from MEC to the CA regions, many models have suggested that a feedforward network can transform grid cell firing into robust place cell firing. However, these models generate place fields that are consistently too small compared to those recorded in experiments. Here, we argue that it is implausible that grid cell activity alone can be transformed into place cells with robust place fields of realistic size in a feedforward network. We propose two solutions to this problem. Firstly, weakly spatially modulated cells, which are abundant throughout EC, provide input to downstream place cells along with grid cells. This simple model reproduces many place cell characteristics as well as results from lesion studies. Secondly, the recurrent connections between place cells in the CA3 network generate robust and realistic place fields. Both mechanisms could work in parallel in the hippocampal formation and this redundancy might account for the robustness of place cell responses to a range of disruptions of the hippocampal circuitry.},

It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of neural networks in the setting of Riemannian geometry. From this perspective, the following theoretical results are developed and proven for feedforward networks. First it is shown that residual neural networks are finite difference approximations to dynamical systems of first order differential equations, as opposed to ordinary networks that are static. This implies that the network is learning systems of differential equations governing the coordinate transformations that represent the data. Second it is shown that a closed form solution of the metric tensor on the underlying data manifold can be found by backpropagating the coordinate representations learned by the neural network itself. This is formulated in a formal abstract sense as a sequence of Lie group actions on the metric fibre space in the principal and associated bundles on the data manifold. Toy experiments were run to confirm parts of the proposed theory, as well as to provide intuitions as to how neural networks operate on data.},

Selective damage to medial septal cholinergic neurons generally has little effect on landmark-based navigation, or the underlying neural representations of location and directional heading in visual environments. In contrast, the loss of cholinergic neurons disrupts navigation based on path integration, but no studies have tested whether these path integration deficits are associated with disrupted head direction (HD) cell activity. We therefore evaluated HD cell responses to visual cue rotations in a familiar arena, and during navigation between familiar and novel arenas, following muscarinic receptor blockade with systemic atropine. Atropine treatment reduced the peak firing rate of HD cells, but failed to significantly affect other HD cell firing properties. Atropine also failed to significantly disrupt the dominant landmark control of the HD signal, even though we used a procedure that challenged this landmark control. In contrast, atropine disrupted HD cell stability during navigation between familiar and novel arenas, where path integration normally maintains a consistent HD cell signal across arenas. These results suggest that acetylcholine contributes to path integration, in part, by facilitating the use of idiothetic cues to maintain a consistent representation of directional heading.},

	abstract = {Novelty seeking refers to the tendency of humans and animals to explore novel and unfamiliar stimuli and environments. The idea that dopamine modulates novelty seeking is supported by evidence that novel stimuli excite dopamine neurons and activate brain regions receiving dopaminergic input. In addition, dopamine is shown to drive exploratory behavior in novel environments. It is not clear whether dopamine promotes novelty seeking when it is framed as the decision to explore novel options versus the exploitation of familiar options. To test this hypothesis, we administered systemic injections of saline or GBR-12909, a selective dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor, to monkeys and assessed their novelty seeking behavior during a probabilistic decision making task. The task involved pseudorandom introductions of novel choice options. This allowed monkeys the opportunity to explore novel options or to exploit familiar options that they had already sampled. We found that DAT blockade increased the monkeys’ preference for novel options. A reinforcement learning (RL) model fit to the monkeys’ choice data showed that increased novelty seeking after DAT blockade was driven by an increase in the initial value the monkeys assigned to novel options. However, blocking DAT did not modulate the rate at which the monkeys learned which cues were most predictive of reward or their tendency to exploit that knowledge. These data demonstrate that dopamine enhances novelty-driven value and imply that excessive novelty seeking—characteristic of impulsivity and behavioral addictions—might be caused by increases in dopamine, stemming from less reuptake.

This reconfiguration is crucial for the flexibility of the nervous system to respond on an input-modulated basis. Such a functional rearrangement is realized by modification of intrinsic properties of the neural circuits including synaptic interactions. Dopamine is an important neuromodulator involved in motivation and stimulus-reward learning process, and adjusts synaptic dynamics in multiple time scales through different pathways. The modification of synaptic plasticity by dopamine underlies the change in synaptic transmission and integration mechanisms, which affects intrinsic properties of the neural system including membrane excitability, probability of neurotransmitters release, receptors’ response to neurotransmitters, protein trafficking, and gene transcription. Dopamine also plays a central role in behavioral control, whereas its malfunction can cause cognitive disorders. Impaired dopamine signaling is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction, schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette’s syndrome. Therefore, dopamine plays a crucial role in the nervous system, where its proper modulation of neural circuits may enhance plasticity-related procedures, but disturbances in dopamine signaling might be involved in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, several computational models are proposed to formulate the involvement of dopamine in synaptic plasticity or neuropsychiatric disorders and address their connection based on the experimental findings.},

The elitist CMA-ES turns out to be slightly faster on unimodal functions, but is more prone to getting stuck in sub-optimal local minima. In the new multi-objective CMAES (MO-CMA-ES) a population of individuals that adapt their search strategy as in the elitist CMA-ES is maintained. These are subject to multi-objective selection. The selection is based on non-dominated sorting using either the crowding-distance or the contributing hypervolume as second sorting criterion. Both the elitist single-objective CMA-ES and the MO-CMA-ES inherit important invariance properties, in particular invariance against rotation of the search space, from the original CMA-ES.

	abstract = {The activity of neurons in the visual cortex is often characterized by tuning curves, which are thought to be shaped by Hebbian plasticity during development and sensory experience. This leads to the prediction that neural circuits should be organized such that neurons with similar functional preference are connected with stronger weights. In support of this idea, previous experimental and theoretical work have provided evidence for a model of the visual cortex characterized by such functional subnetworks. A recent experimental study, however, have found that the postsynaptic preferred stimulus was defined by the total number of spines activated by a given stimulus and independent of their individual strength. While this result might seem to contradict previous literature, there are many factors that define how a given synaptic input influences postsynaptic selectivity. Here, we designed a computational model in which postsynaptic functional preference is defined by the number of inputs activated by a given stimulus. Using a plasticity rule where synaptic weights tend to correlate with presynaptic selectivity, and is independent of functional-similarity between pre- and postsynaptic activity, we find that this model can be used to decode presented stimuli in a manner that is comparable to maximum likelihood inference., Brains are composed of complex networks, with communication taking place along synaptic connections between neurons. These connections can change and adapt, a process we call “plasticity”. However, the specific rules that dictate these changes remain largely unknown. In our visual system, which is responsible for vision and perception, it is primarily thought that connections get stronger between neurons exhibiting similar activity, also known as ‘Hebbian plasticity’. A recent study revealed results that seemed to contradict this idea, showing a strength in numbers of synapses rather than strength. Prompted by these findings, we developed a computational model with a hypothesis about how these changes could occur. We discovered that this new model, with a plasticity mechanism based on presynaptic activity, could capture experimental findings and lead to benefits in population decoding. Our model doesn’t necessarily contradict a Hebbian model, but rather, likely co-exists with it.},

	abstract = {The ‘cognitive map’ hypothesis proposes that brain builds a unified representation of the spatial environment to support memory and guide future action. Forty years of electrophysiological research in rodents suggests that cognitive maps are neurally instantiated by place, grid, border, and head direction cells in the hippocampal formation and related structures. Here we review recent work that suggests a similar functional organization in the human brain and reveals novel insights into how cognitive maps are used during spatial navigation. Specifically, these studies indicate that: (i) the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support map-like spatial codes; (ii) posterior brain regions such as parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices provide critical inputs that allow cognitive maps to be anchored to fixed environmental landmarks; (iii) hippocampal and entorhinal spatial codes are used in conjunction with frontal lobe mechanisms to plan routes during navigation. We also discuss how these three basic elements of cognitive map based navigation spatial coding, landmark anchoring, and route planning might be applied to non-spatial domains to provide the building blocks for many core elements of human thought.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the relations between cognitive maps, spatial abilities and human wayfinding, particularly in the context of traveling without the use of sight. Initially we discuss the nature of cognitive maps and the process of cognitive mapping as mechanisms for developing person to object (egocentric) and object to object (allocentric) internal representations. Imperfections in encoding either relations can introduce imperfections in representations of environments in memory. This, together with individual differences in human spatial abilities, can result in data manipulations that produce error. When information stored in long term memory is brought into working memory for purposes of decision making and choice behavior (as in route selection), the result may be the selection of an inefficient or incorrect path. We explore the connection between environmental learning and cognitive maps in the context of learning a route in two different cultural environments-Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Santa Barbara (California). Blind, vision impaired and sighted volunteers traveled and learned routes of approximately the same length (1.2 miles) in their respective urban environments. An initial trial was experimenter guided: three following trials were regarded as "test" trials where the participants learned the route and performed route fixing tasks including pointing between designated places, verbally describing the route after each completion, and building a model of the route using metallics strips on a magnetic board. Results indicated that by the end of the third test trial, and using the reinforcing strategies, the results of the blind or vision impaired participants could not be statistically differentiated from those of the sighted participants. This indicated that the wayfinding abilities of the three groups were equivalent in this experiments and suggested that spatial abilities were potentially the same in each group but that lack of sight interfered with putting knowledge into action.},

	abstract = {A basic set of navigation strategies supports navigational tasks ranging from homing to novel detours and shortcuts. To perform these last two tasks, it is generally thought that humans, mammals and perhaps some insects possess Euclidean cognitive maps, constructed on the basis of input from the path integration system. In this article, I review the rationale and behavioral evidence for this metric cognitive map hypothesis, and find it unpersuasive: in practice, there is little evidence for truly novel shortcuts in animals, and human performance is highly unreliable and biased by environmental features. I develop the alternative hypothesis that spatial knowledge is better characterized as a labeled graph: a network of paths between places augmented with local metric information. What distinguishes such a cognitive graph from a metric cognitive map is that this local information is not embedded in a global coordinate system, so spatial knowledge is often geometrically inconsistent. Human path integration appears to be better suited to piecewise measurements of path lengths and turn angles than to building a consistent map. In a series of experiments in immersive virtual reality, we tested human navigation in non-Euclidean environments and found that shortcuts manifest large violations of the metric postulates. The results are contrary to the Euclidean map hypothesis and support the cognitive graph hypothesis. Apparently Euclidean behavior, such as taking novel detours and approximate shortcuts, can be explained by the adaptive use of non-Euclidean strategies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spatial navigation is one of the most frequently used behavioral paradigms to study memory formation in rodents. Commonly used tasks to study memory are labor-intensive, preventing the simultaneous testing of multiple animals with the tendency to yield a low number of trials, curtailing the statistical power. Moreover, they are not tailored to be combined with neurophysiology recordings because they are not based on overt stereotyped behavioral responses that can be precisely timed. Here we present a novel task to study long-term memory formation and recall during spatial navigation. The task consists of learning sessions during which mice need to find the rewarding port that changes from day to day. Hours after learning, there is a recall session during which mice search for the location of the memorized rewarding port. During the recall sessions, the animals repeatedly poke the remembered port over many trials (up to ∼20) without receiving a reward (i.e., no positive feedback) as a readout of memory. In this task, mice show memory of port locations learned on up to three previous days. This eight-port maze task requires minimal human intervention, allowing for simultaneous and unsupervised testing of several mice in parallel, yielding a high number of recall trials per session over many days, and compatible with recordings of neural activity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We developed a novel open-field navigation task (“Tartarus maze”) requiring dynamic adaptation (shortcuts and detours) to frequently changing obstructions on the path to a hidden goal. Humans and rats were remarkably similar in their trajectories. Both species showed the greatest similarity to RL agents utilizing a “successor representation,” which creates a predictive map. Humans also displayed trajectory features similar to model-based RL agents, which implemented an optimal tree-search planning procedure. Our results help refine models seeking to explain mammalian navigation in dynamic environments and highlight the utility of modeling the behavior of different species to uncover the shared mechanisms that support behavior.,

	abstract = {How do we make sense of the input from our sensory organs, and put the perceived information into context of our past experiences? The hippocampal-entorhinal complex plays a major role in the organization of memory and thought. The formation of and navigation in cognitive maps of arbitrary mental spaces via place and grid cells can serve as a representation of memories and experiences and their relations to each other. The multi-scale successor representation is proposed to be the mathematical principle underlying place and grid cell computations. Here, we present a neural network, which learns a cognitive map of a semantic space based on 32 different animal species encoded as feature vectors. The neural network successfully learns the similarities between different animal species, and constructs a cognitive map of ‘animal space’ based on the principle of successor representations with an accuracy of around 30\% which is near to the theoretical maximum regarding the fact that all animal species have more than one possible successor, i.e. nearest neighbor in feature space. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure, i.e. different scales of cognitive maps, can be modeled based on multi-scale successor representations. We find that, in fine-grained cognitive maps, the animal vectors are evenly distributed in feature space. In contrast, in coarse-grained maps, animal vectors are highly clustered according to their biological class, i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects. This could be a putative mechanism enabling the emergence of new, abstract semantic concepts. Finally, even completely new or incomplete input can be represented by interpolation of the representations from the cognitive map with remarkable high accuracy of up to 95\%. We conclude that the successor representation can serve as a weighted pointer to past memories and experiences, and may therefore be a crucial building block to include prior knowledge, and to derive context knowledge from novel input. Thus, our model provides a new tool to complement contemporary deep learning approaches on the road towards artificial general intelligence.},

Schemas have been studied separately in the realms of episodic memory and spatial navigation across different species and have been grounded in theories of memory consolidation, but there has been little attempt to integrate our understanding across domains, particularly in humans. We propose that experiences during navigation with many similarly structured environments give rise to the formation of spatial schemas (for example, the expected layout of modern cities) that share properties with but are distinct from cognitive maps (for example, the memory of a modern city) and event schemas (such as expected events in a modern city) at both cognitive and neural levels. We describe earlier theoretical frameworks and empirical findings relevant to spatial schemas, along with more targeted investigations of spatial schemas in human and non-human animals. Consideration of architecture and urban analytics, including the influence of scale and regionalization, on different properties of spatial schemas may provide a powerful approach to advance our understanding of spatial schemas.},

Previously, we used the dopamine neurons to measure the functional role of OFC. We recorded midbrain dopamine neurons as rats performed an odor-based choice task, in which expected rewards were manipulated across blocks. We found that ipsilateral OFC lesions degraded dopaminergic prediction errors, consistent with reduced resolution of the task states. Here we have repeated this experiment in male rats with ipsilateral HC lesions. The results show HC also shapes the task states, however unlike OFC, which provides information local to the trial, the HC is necessary for estimating upper-level hidden states that distinguish blocks. The results contrast the roles of the OFC and HC in cognitive mapping and suggest that the dopamine neurons access rich information from distributed regions regarding the environment’s structure, potentially enabling this teaching signal to support complex behaviors.},

	abstract = {Journeys to novel and familiar destinations employ different navigational strategies. The first drive to a new restaurant relies on map-based planning, but after repeated trips the drive is automatic and guided by local environmental cues1,2. Ventral striatal dopamine rises during navigation toward goals and reflects the spatial proximity and value of goals3, but the impact of experience, the neural mechanisms, and the functional significance of dopamine ramps are unknown4,5. Here, we used fiber photometry6–8 to record the evolution of activity in midbrain dopamine neurons as mice learned a variety of reward-seeking tasks, starting recordings before training had commenced and continuing daily for weeks. When mice navigated through space toward a goal, robust ramping activity in dopamine neurons appeared immediately – after the first rewarded trial on the first training day in completely naïve animals. In this task spatial cues were available to guide behavior, and although ramps were strong at first, they gradually faded away as training progressed. If instead mice learned to run a fixed distance on a stationary wheel for reward, a task that required an internal model of progress toward the goal, strong dopamine ramps persisted indefinitely. In a passive task in which a visible cue and reward moved together toward the mouse, ramps appeared and then faded over several days, but in an otherwise identical task with a stationary cue and reward ramps never appeared. Our findings provide strong evidence that ramping activity in midbrain dopamine neurons reflects the use of a cognitive map9,10 – an internal model of the distance already covered and the remaining distance until the goal is reached. We hypothesize that dopamine ramps may be used to reinforce locations on the way to newly-discovered rewards in order to build a graded ventral striatal value landscape for guiding routine spatial behavior.},

	abstract = {Journeys to novel and familiar destinations employ different navigational strategies. The first drive to a new restaurant relies on map-based planning, but after repeated trips the drive is automatic and guided by local environmental cues1,2. Ventral striatal dopamine rises during navigation toward goals and reflects the spatial proximity and value of goals3, but the impact of experience, the neural mechanisms, and the functional significance of dopamine ramps are unknown4,5. Here, we used fiber photometry6–8 to record the evolution of activity in midbrain dopamine neurons as mice learned a variety of reward-seeking tasks, starting recordings before training had commenced and continuing daily for weeks. When mice navigated through space toward a goal, robust ramping activity in dopamine neurons appeared immediately – after the first rewarded trial on the first training day in completely naïve animals. In this task spatial cues were available to guide behavior, and although ramps were strong at first, they gradually faded away as training progressed. If instead mice learned to run a fixed distance on a stationary wheel for reward, a task that required an internal model of progress toward the goal, strong dopamine ramps persisted indefinitely. In a passive task in which a visible cue and reward moved together toward the mouse, ramps appeared and then faded over several days, but in an otherwise identical task with a stationary cue and reward ramps never appeared. Our findings provide strong evidence that ramping activity in midbrain dopamine neurons reflects the use of a cognitive map9,10 – an internal model of the distance already covered and the remaining distance until the goal is reached. We hypothesize that dopamine ramps may be used to reinforce locations on the way to newly-discovered rewards in order to build a graded ventral striatal value landscape for guiding routine spatial behavior.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spatial learning has been recognized over the years to be under the control of the hippocampus and related temporal lobe structures. Hippocampal damage often causes severe impairments in the ability to learn and remember a location in space defined by distal visual cues. Such cognitive disabilities are found in Parkinsonian patients. We recently investigated the role of dopamine in navigation in the 6-Hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) rat, a model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) commonly used to investigate the pathophysiology of dopamine depletion (Retailleau et al., {\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51"{\textgreater}2013{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}). We demonstrated that dopamine (DA) is essential to spatial learning as its depletion results in spatial impairments. Our results showed that the behavioral effect of DA depletion is correlated with modification of the neural encoding of spatial features and decision making processes in hippocampus. However, the origin of these alterations in the neural processing of the spatial information needs to be clarified. It could result from a local effect: dopamine depletion disturbs directly the processing of relevant spatial information at hippocampal level. Alternatively, it could result from a more distributed network effect: dopamine depletion elsewhere in the brain (entorhinal cortex, striatum, etc.) modifies the way hippocampus processes spatial information. Recent experimental evidence in rodents, demonstrated indeed, that other brain areas are involved in the acquisition of spatial information. Amongst these, the cortex—basal ganglia (BG) loop is known to be involved in reinforcement learning and has been identified as an important contributor to spatial learning. In particular, it has been shown that altered activity of the BG striatal complex can impair the ability to perform spatial learning tasks. The present review provides a glimpse of the findings obtained over the past decade that support a dialog between these two structures during spatial learning under DA control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning and behaviour. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus1, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.},

Psychophysical studies have indicated that humans and nonhuman primates integrate the two cues to improve the estimation of self-motion direction, often in a statistically Bayesian-optimal way. In the last decade, single-unit recordings in awake, behaving animals have provided valuable neurophysiological data with a high spatial and temporal resolution, giving insight into possible neural mechanisms underlying multisensory self-motion perception. Here, we review these findings, along with new evidence from the most recent studies focusing on the temporal dynamics of signals in different modalities. We show that, in light of new data, conventional thoughts about the cortical mechanisms underlying visuo-vestibular integration for linear self-motion are challenged. We propose that different temporal component signals may mediate different functions, a possibility that requires future studies.},

Here, we summarize classic and recent work on self-motion coding in the visual and entorhinal cortices of the rodent brain. We compare motion processing in rodent and primate visual cortices, highlighting the strengths of classic primate work in establishing causal links between neural activity and perception, and discuss the integration of motor and visual signals in rodent visual cortex. We then turn to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), where calculations using self-motion to update position estimates are thought to occur. We focus on several key sources of self-motion information to MEC: the medial septum, which provides locomotor speed information; visual cortex, whose input has been increasingly recognized as essential to both position and speed-tuned MEC cells; and the head direction system, which is a major source of directional information for self-motion estimates. These inputs create a large and diverse group of self-motion codes in MEC, and great interest remains in how these self-motion codes might be integrated by MEC grid cells to estimate position. However, which signals are used in these calculations and the mechanisms by which they are integrated remain controversial. We end by proposing future experiments that could further our understanding of the interactions between MEC cells that code for self-motion and position and clarify the relationship between the activity of these cells and spatial perception.},

It is an inherently multisensory process, that combines inertial (body-based) and relative (with respect to the environment) motion cues. While extensively studied in human and non-human primates, there is currently no paradigm to test self-motion perception in rodents using both inertial and relative self-motion cues. We developed a novel rodent motion simulator using two synchronized robotic arms to generate inertial, relative or combined (inertial and relative) cues of self-motion. Eight rats were trained to perform a task of heading-discrimination, similar to the popular primate paradigm. Strikingly, the rats relied heavily on airflow for relative self-motion perception, with little contribution from optic flow (performance in the dark was almost as good). Relative self-motion (airflow) was perceived with greater reliability vs. inertial. Disrupting airflow (using a fan or windshield) damaged relative, but not inertial, self-motion perception. However, whiskers were not needed for this function. Lastly, the rats integrated relative and inertial self-motion cues in a reliability-based (Bayesian-like) manner. These results implicate airflow as a dominant cue for self-motion perception in rats, and provide a new domain to investigate the neural bases of self-motion perception and multisensory processing in awake behaving rodents.},

	abstract = {To navigate and guide adaptive behaviour in a dynamic environment, animals must accurately estimate their own motion relative to the external world. This is a fundamentally multisensory process involving integration of visual, vestibular and kinesthetic inputs. Ideal observer models, paired with careful neurophysiological investigation, helped to reveal how visual and vestibular signals are combined to support perception of linear self-motion direction, or heading. Recent work has extended these findings by emphasizing the dimension of time, both with regard to stimulus dynamics and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Both time and certainty—i.e. the degree of confidence in a multisensory decision—are essential to the ecological goals of the system: terminating a decision process is necessary for timely action, and predicting one's accuracy is critical for making multiple decisions in a sequence, as in navigation. Here, we summarize a leading model for multisensory decision-making, then show how the model can be extended to study confidence in heading discrimination. Lastly, we preview ongoing efforts to bridge self-motion perception and navigation per se, including closed-loop virtual reality and active self-motion. The design of unconstrained, ethologically inspired tasks, accompanied by large-scale neural recordings, raise promise for a deeper understanding of spatial perception and decision-making in the behaving animal.

When animals need to become reoriented in a mapped space, results from rats and human toddlers indicate that they focus exclusively on the shape of the perceived environment, ignoring non-geometric features such as surface colors. As a result, in a rectangular space, they are misoriented half the time even when the two ends of the space differ strikingly in their appearance. In searching for a hidden object after becoming reoriented, both kinds of subjects search on the basis of the object’s mapped position in the space rather than on the basis of its relationship to a goal sign (e.g. a distinctive container or nearby marker), even though they have demonstrably noted the relationship between the goal and the goal sign.

	abstract = {Spatial perception and cognitive mapping are two areas of research that invite comparison since they both involve fundamental geometric concepts, and researchers have applied psychophysical methods to examine spatial judgments in both domains. The first part of article discusses research that assesses the degree to which spatial judgments conform to various geometric axioms. In general, both spatial perception and cognitive maps violate many of the most fundamental geometric axioms, including metric axioms, compactness, the Desarguesian postulate, and free mobility. Of the two, cognitive maps show the most striking violations of even the most basic geometric concepts, including symmetry, transitivity, and Riemannian manifoldness. The second and larger part of this article performs a meta-analysis on psychophysical judgments for size and distance, comparing judgments made in perception research to those found with cognitive maps. The most striking results are that cognitive maps produce much lower power function exponents and much lower coefficients of determination for size and distance estimation than perception does. The meta-analysis presented here also shows that a number of the same factors influence both types of distance estimates including judgment method, whether judgments occur inside or outside, and stimulus range. Cognitive mapping exponents also rise with acquisition time and decline with increasing environment size. Several multivariate analyses are performed to yield a set of general psychophysical equations to predict size and distance estimates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The idea that humans use flexible map-like representations of their environment to guide spatial navigation has a long and controversial history. One reason for this enduring controversy might be that individuals vary considerably in their ability to form and utilize cognitive maps. Here we investigate the behavioral and neuroanatomical signatures of these individual differences. Participants learned an unfamiliar campus environment over a period of three weeks. In their first visit, they learned the position of different buildings along two routes in separate areas of the campus. During the following weeks, they learned these routes for a second and third time, along with two paths that connected both areas of the campus. Behavioral assessments after each learning session indicated that subjects formed a coherent representation of the spatial structure of the entire campus after learning a single connecting path. Volumetric analyses of structural MRI data and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) indicated that the size of the right posterior hippocampus predicted the ability to use this spatial knowledge to make inferences about the relative positions of different buildings on the campus. An inverse relationship between gray matter volume and performance was observed in the caudate. These results suggest that (i) humans can rapidly acquire cognitive maps of large-scale environments and (ii) individual differences in hippocampal anatomy may provide the neuroanatomical substrate for individual differences in the ability to learn and flexibly use these cognitive maps. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Navigation has always been an interdisciplinary topic of research, because mobile agents of different types are inevitably faced with similar navigational problems. Therefore, human navigation can readily be compared to navigation in other biological organisms or in artificial mobile agents like autonomous robots. One such navigational strategy, route-based navigation, in which an agent moves from one location to another by following a particular route, is the focus of this paper. Drawing on the research from cognitive psychology and linguistics, biology, and robotics, we present a simple, abstract formalism to express the key concepts of route-based navigation in a common scientific language. Starting with the distinction of places and route segments, we develop the notion of a route graph, which can serve as the basis for complex navigational knowledge. Implications and constraints of the model are discussed along the way, together with examples of different instantiations of parts of the model in different mobile agents. By providing this common conceptual framework, we hope to advance the interdisciplinary discussion of spatial navigation.},

These patterns can be used to discover the organization of the knowledge we use to find our way around in everyday life.In the first experiment, 80 undergraduates estimated by ratio scaling the walking distances between pairs of locations in St. Andrews. Routes varied independently in their location, number of major bends, and length. Relative overestimation of length was found with routes in the town centre, with routes having several major bends, and (perhaps as an experimental artifact) with short routes. In the second experiment, 30 Cambridge residents estimated the angles between pairs of roads, by drawing the configuration of roads at their junctions. The real angles were either in the range 60–70° or 110–120°. All the estimates differed little from 90°, regardless of the true magnitude of the angle.The implications of these findings for theories of mental representation of largescale space are discussed. A model is supported in which a spatial area is represented as a “network-map”, consisting of strings of locations forming a net of paths known to be traversable, but vector distance is not preserved.},

When animals move, activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal’s displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These ‘speed cells’ are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50–80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.},

This supports the hypothesis that only distances between neighboring objects are explicitly encoded. Experiment 3 tested whether survey knowledge can emerge after route learning.

The addition of an overall directional reference allows for the buildup of more complete (allocentric) representations.

	abstract = {Social hymenopterans such as bees and ants are central-place foragers; they regularly depart from and return to fixed positions in their environment. In returning to the starting point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference. In the first case, they would rely on information continuously collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e. integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at least by some authors, to use a map-based system of navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental framework.In bees and ants, path integration employing a skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation, but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well. This information is obtained while the animal is dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore, this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of reference.In this way, geocentred information might more and more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred information provided by the path-integration system. In competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees itself of its homeward-bound vector – its safety-line, so to speak – by which it is always linked to home. Vector information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept of the mental analogue of a topographic map – a metric map – assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to interpret the insect’s behaviour.The cognitive-map approach in particular, and the representational paradigm in general, are discussed.},

Here we studied the ability of human subjects to search locations, to find shortcuts and novel paths, to estimate distances between remembered places, and to draw sketch maps of the explored environment; these competences are related to goal-independent memory of space, or cognitive maps. Information on spatial relations was restricted to two types: a visual motion sequence generated by simulated movements in a virtual maze and the subject's own movement decisions defining the path through the maze. Visual information was local (i.e., no global landmarks or compass information was provided). Other position and movement information (vestibular or proprioceptive) was excluded. The amount of visual information provided was varied over four experimental conditions. The results indicate that human subjects are able to learn a virtual maze from sequences of local views and movements. The information acquired is local, consisting of recognized positions and movement decisions associated to them. Although simple associations of this type can be shown to be present in some subjects, more complete configurational knowledge is acquired as well.

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that the foundation of mammalian spatial orientation and learning is based on an internal network that can keep track of relative position and orientation (from an arbitrary starting point) on the basis of integration of self-motion cues derived from locomotion, vestibular activation and optic flow (path integration).Place cells in the hippocampal formation exhibit elevated activity at discrete spots in a given environment, and this spatial representation is determined primarily on the basis of which cells were active at the starting point and how far and in what direction the animal has moved since then. Environmental features become associatively bound to this intrinsic spatial framework and can serve to correct for cumulative error in the path integration process.Theoretical studies suggested that a path integration system could involve cooperative interactions (attractor dynamics) among a population of place coding neurons, the synaptic coupling of which defines a two-dimensional attractor map. These cells would communicate with an additional group of neurons, the activity of which depends on the conjunction of movement speed, location and orientation (head direction) information, allowing position on the attractor map to be updated by self-motion information.The attractor map hypothesis contains an inherent boundary problem: what happens when the animal's movements carry it beyond the boundary of the map? One solution to this problem is to make the boundaries of the map periodic by coupling neurons at each edge to those on the opposite edge, resulting in a toroidal synaptic matrix. This solution predicts that, in a sufficiently large space, place cells would exhibit a regularly spaced grid of place fields, something that has never been observed in the hippocampus proper.Recent discoveries in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), the main source of hippocampal afferents, indicate that these cells do have regularly spaced place fields (grid cells). In addition, cells in the deeper layers of this structure exhibit grid fields that are conjunctive for head orientation and movement speed. Pure head direction neurons are also found there. Therefore, all of the components of previous theoretical models for path integration appear in the MEC, suggesting that this network is the core of the path integration system.The scale of MEC spatial firing grids increases systematically from the dorsal to the ventral poles of this structure, in much the same way as is observed for hippocampal place cells, and we show how non-periodic hippocampal place fields could arise from the combination of inputs from entorhinal grid cells, if the inputs cover a range of spatial scales rather than a single scale. This phenomenon, in the spatial domain, is analogous to the low frequency 'beats' heard when two pure tones of slightly different frequencies are combined.The problem of how a two-dimensional synaptic matrix with periodic boundary conditions, postulated to underlie grid cell behaviour, could be self-organized in early development is addressed. Based on principles derived from Alan Turing's theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking in chemical systems, we suggest that topographically organized, grid-like patterns of neural activity might be present in the immature cortex, and that these activity patterns guide the development of the proposed periodic synaptic matrix through a mechanism involving competitive synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {The capacity to construct a cognitive map is hypothesized to rest on two foundations: (1) dead reckoning (path integration); (2) the perception of the direction and distance of terrain features relative to the animal. A map may be constructed by combining these two sources of positional information, with the result that the positions of all terrain features are represented in the coordinate framework used for dead reckoning. When animals need to become reoriented in a mapped space, results from rats and human toddlers indicate that they focus exclusively on the shape of the perceived environment, ignoring non-geometric features such as surface colors. As a result, in a rectangular space, they are misoriented half the time even when the two ends of the space differ strikingly in their appearance. In searching for a hidden object after becoming reoriented, both kinds of subjects search on the basis of the object’s mapped position in the space rather than on the basis of its relationship to a goal sign (e.g. a distinctive container or nearby marker), even though they have demonstrably noted the relationship between the goal and the goal sign. When choosing a multidestination foraging route, vervet monkeys look at least three destinations ahead, even though they are only capable of keeping a maximum of six destinations in mind at once.},

	abstract = {The discovery of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex quickly led to the hypothesis that grid cell inputs might be responsible for the generation of discrete place fields downstream in the hippocampus. Simulations have shown that if this conjecture is correct, then lesions of dorsal medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which expresses the most tightly spaced grids, should cause place fields to expand, whereas lesions of ventral MEC, which expresses the most widely spaced grids, should cause fields to contract. Using muscimol to make small inactivations along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC, we tested this hypothesis. Our results deviate from the prediction but most likely result from a combination of the predicted effects and a weakening of the self-motion signal within the MEC., Both hippocampal place fields and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid fields increase in scale along the dorsoventral axis. Because the connections from MEC to hippocampus are topographically organized and divergent, it has been hypothesized that place fields are generated by a Fourier-like summation of inputs over a range of spatial scales. This hypothesis predicts that inactivation of dorsal MEC should cause place field expansion, whereas inactivation of ventral MEC should cause field contraction. Inactivation of dorsal MEC caused substantial expansion of place fields; however, as inactivations were made more ventrally, the effect diminished but never switched to contraction. Expansion was accompanied by proportional decreases in theta power, intrinsic oscillation frequencies, phase precession slopes, and firing rates. Our results are most consistent with the predicted loss of specific Fourier components coupled with a path integration gain reduction, which raises the overall place field scale and masks the contraction expected from ventral inactivations.},

	abstract = {The representation of distinct spaces by hippocampal place cells has been linked to changes in their place fields (the locations in the environment where the place cells discharge strongly), a phenomenon that has been termed ‘remapping’. Remapping has been assumed to be accompanied by the reorganization of subsecond cofiring relationships among the place cells, potentially maximizing hippocampal information coding capacity. However, several observations challenge this standard view. For example, place cells exhibit mixed selectivity, encode non-positional variables, can have multiple place fields and exhibit unreliable discharge in fixed environments. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that, when measured at subsecond timescales, the moment-to-moment cofiring of a pair of cells in one environment is remarkably similar in another environment, despite remapping. Here, I propose that remapping is a misnomer for the changes in place fields across environments and suggest instead that internally organized manifold representations of hippocampal activity are actively registered to different environments to enable navigation, promote memory and organize knowledge.},

Nongeometric information may allow the discrimination of different spatial contexts. Understanding how nongeometric (or contextual) information affects hippocampal activity is important in light of proposals that the hippocampus may play a role in constructing a representation of spatial context. We investigated the contextual modulation of place cell activity by recording hippocampal place cells while rats foraged in compound contexts comprising black or white color paired with lemon or vanilla odor. Some cells responded to the color or odor changes alone, but most responded to varying combinations of both. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a heterogeneous input by contextual inputs into the hippocampus. We propose a model of contextual remapping of place cells in which the geometric inputs are selectively activated by subsets of contextual stimuli. Because it appears that different place cells are affected by different subsets of contextual stimuli, the representation of the entire context would require activity at the population level, supporting a role for the hippocampus in constructing a representation of spatial context.},

In this study, we further investigate grid cells as a metric of space by optimising them for a conformal isometric (CI) map of space using a model based on a superposition of plane waves. By optimising the phases within a single grid cell module, we find that the module can form a CI of two-dimensional flat space with phases arranging into a regular hexagonal pattern, supporting an accurate spatial metric. Additionally, we find that experimentally recorded grid cells exhibit CI properties, with one example module showing a phase arrangement similar to the hexagonal pattern observed in our model. These findings provide computational and preliminary experimental support for grid cells as a CI-based spatial representation. We also examine other properties that emerge in CI-optimised modules, including consistent energy expenditure across space and the minimal cell count required to support unique representation of space and maximally topologically persistent toroidal population activity. Altogether, our results suggest that grid cells are well-suited to form a CI map, with several beneficial properties arising from this organisation.},

	abstract = {The structure of the internal representation of surrounding space, the so-called cognitive map, has long been debated. A Euclidean metric map is the most straight-forward hypothesis, but human navigation has been shown to systematically deviate from the Euclidean ground truth. Vector navigation based on non-metric models can better explain the observed behavior, but also discards useful geometric properties such as fast shortcut estimation and cue integration., Here, we propose another alternative, a Euclidean metric map that is systematically distorted to account for the observed behavior. The map is found by embedding the non-metric model, a labeled graph, into 2D Euclidean coordinates. We compared these two models using data from a human behavioral study where participants had to learn and navigate a non-Euclidean maze (i.e., with wormholes) and perform direct shortcuts between different locations. Even though the Euclidean embedding cannot correctly represent the non-Euclidean environment, both models predicted the data equally well. We argue that the embedding naturally arises from integrating the local position information into a metric framework, which makes the model more powerful and robust than the non-metric alternative. It may therefore be a better model for the human cognitive map., How is the metric of space, i.e., knowledge about distances and angles between places, represented in the brain? Existing theories argue for either purely relational topological graphs without a metric, or consistent Euclidean maps where each place is assigned specific coordinates. The problem lies in the fact that human behavior systematically deviates from perfect metric maps, and theories need to account for these deviations., We propose an intermediate model that has both properties of non-metric graphs and metric maps, by embedding a graph labeled with local position information into metric space. In this “embedded graph”, measurements of local metric information also affect the estimates of adjacent distances and turning angles. The result is a consolidated spatial representation which is still a graph, but whose local metric labels are globally optimized to match the available egomotion measurements. We show that the embedded graph is consistent with human behavior in a (virtual) non-Euclidean environment and argue that it is a natural consequence of the optimal integration of repeated local measurements over time.},

We recorded place cell activity in rats exploring morphing linear tracks that allowed us to dissociate the geometry of the track from its topology. The resulting place fields preserved the relative sequence of places visited along the track but did not vary with the metrical features of the track or the direction of the rat's movement.

What mechanisms enable this fast encoding of experience? Using virtual reality and neural population recordings in mice, we dissected the effects of novelty and experience on the dynamics of place field formation. Place fields of many CA1 neurons shift locations and modulate the amplitude of their activity immediately after place field formation, rapid changes predicted by behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity. These correlates were particularly enriched during exploration of a novel context and decayed with experience. Our data suggest that novelty modulates the effective learning rate in CA1, favoring rapid mechanisms of field formation to encode new experience., Combining virtual reality and two-photon calcium imaging, Priestley et al find pervasive signatures of rapid neural plasticity mechanisms in the mouse hippocampus during new experiences. Their study highlights a strong regulation of neural feature tuning in CA1 by novelty, which could contribute to efficiently encoding new memories.},

In rodents, hippocampal pyramidal neurons fire in a location-specific manner, forming relational representations of environmental cues. The importance of glutamatergic systems in learning and in hippocampal neural synaptic plasticity has been shown. However, the role of dopaminergic systems in the response of hippocampal neural plasticity to novel and familiar spatial stimuli remains unclear. To clarify this important issue, we recorded hippocampal neurons from dopamine D1 receptor knock-out (D1R-KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates under the manipulation of distinct spatial cues in a familiar and a novel environment. Here we report that in WT mice, the majority of place cells quickly responded to the manipulations of distal and proximal cues in both familiar and novel environments. In contrast, the influence of distal cues on spatial firing in D1R-KO mice was abolished. In the D1R-KO mice, the influence of proximal cues was facilitated in a familiar environment, and in a novel environment most of the place cells were less likely to respond to changes of spatial cues. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal neurons in mice can rapidly and flexibly encode information about space from both distal and proximal cues to cipher a novel environment. This ability is necessary for many types of learning, and lacking D1R can radically alter this learning-related neural activity. We propose that D1R is crucially implicated in encoding spatial information in novel environments, and influences the plasticity of hippocampal representations, which is important in spatial learning and memory.},

Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) also have spatio-temporal properties similar to hippocampal place cells, except that grid cells respond to multiple spatial locations that form a hexagonal pattern. Other non-grid spatial cells are also abundant in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Because the EC is the upstream area that projects strongly to the hippocampus, a number of EC-hippocampus models have been proposed to explain how the spatial receptive field properties of place cells emerge. However, none of these learning models have explained how the temporal response properties of hippocampal place cells emerge as a result of the EC input. A learning model is presented here based on non-negative sparse coding in which we show that the spatial and temporal properties of hippocampal place cells can be simultaneously learnt from EC input: both MEC grid cells and other EC spatial cells contribute to the spatial properties of hippocampal place cells while MEC grid cells predominantly determine the temporal response properties of hippocampal place cells.},

Participants learned exactly the same layout of objects either within a single room or spread across multiple corridors. By utilizing a pointing and a placement task we tested the acquired configurational memory. In Experiment 1 retrieving memory of the object layout acquired in environmental space was affected by the distance of the traveled path and the order in which the objects were learned. In contrast, memory retrieval of objects learned in vista space was not bound to distance and relied on different ordering schemes (e.g., along the layout structure). Furthermore, spatial memory of both spaces differed with respect to the employed reference frame orientation. Environmental space memory was organized along the learning experience rather than layout intrinsic structure. In Experiment 2 participants memorized the object layout presented within the vista space room of Experiment 1 while the learning procedure emulated environmental space learning (movement, successive object presentation). Neither factor rendered similar results as found in environmental space learning. This shows that memory differences between vista and environmental space originated mainly from the spatial compartmentalization which was unique to environmental space learning. Our results suggest that transferring conclusions from findings obtained in vista space to environmental spaces and vice versa should be made with caution.},

	abstract = {For energy-efficient computation in specialized neuromorphic hardware, we present spiking neural coding, an instantiation of a family of artificial neural models grounded in the theory of predictive coding. This model, the first of its kind, works by operating in a never-ending process of “guess-and-check”, where neurons predict the activity values of one another and then adjust their own activities to make better future predictions. The interactive, iterative nature of our system fits well into the continuous time formulation of sensory stream prediction and, as we show, the model’s structure yields a local synaptic update rule, which can be used to complement or as an alternative to online spike-timing dependent plasticity. In this article, we experiment with an instantiation of our model consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire units. However, the framework within which our system is situated can naturally incorporate more complex neurons such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our experimental results in pattern recognition demonstrate the potential of the model when binary spike trains are the primary paradigm for inter-neuron communication. Notably, spiking neural coding is competitive in terms of classification performance and experiences less forgetting when learning from a task sequence, offering a more computationally economical, biologically-motivated alternative to popular artificial neural networks.},

Here, we present the results of two high resolution human fMRI studies (N = 24 for both experiments) directly investigating this. Participants were exposed to auditory cues that predicted the identity of an upcoming visual shape (with 75\% validity). Using multivoxel decoding analysis, we find that the hippocampus initially preferentially represents unexpected shapes (i.e., those that violate the cue regularities), but later switches to representing the cue-predicted shape regardless of which was actually presented. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus is involved both acquiring and exploiting predictive associations, and is dominated by either errors or predictions depending on whether learning is ongoing or complete.},

We show a faster reorganization and stabilization of the hippocampal place map when a goal location is associated with a large reward. The reorganization is driven by both rate changes and the appearance and disappearance of place fields. The occurrence of hippocampal replay activity largely followed the dynamics of changes in spatial representations. Replay patterns became more selectively tuned toward behaviorally relevant experiences over the course of learning via the refined contributions of specific cell subpopulations. These results suggest that high reward value enhances memory retention by accelerating the formation and stabilization of the hippocampal cognitive map and selectively enhancing its reactivation during learning.},

To test this, we performed two-photon imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice navigated virtual environments with changing hidden reward locations. When the reward moved, the firing fields of a subpopulation of cells moved to the same relative position with respect to reward, constructing a sequence of reward-relative cells that spanned the entire task structure. The density of these reward-relative sequences increased with task experience as additional neurons were recruited to the reward-relative population. Conversely, a largely separate subpopulation maintained a spatially-based place code. These findings thus reveal separate hippocampal ensembles can flexibly encode multiple behaviorally salient reference frames, reflecting the structure of the experience.},

When the relative position of the visual cues is altered, the hippocampal population exhibits heterogeneous responses and constructs context-specific spatial maps. Another critical factor that can strongly modulate spatial representation is the presence of reward. Reward features can drive behavior and are known to bias spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether reward features are used for spatial reference in the presence of distal cues and how the hippocampus population dynamics changes when the association between reward features and distal cues is altered. We systematically investigated these questions by recording place cells from the CA1 in different sets of experiments while the rats ran in an environment with the conflicting association between reward features and distal cues. We report that, when rewards features were only used as local cues, the hippocampal place fields exhibited coherent and dynamical orientation across sessions, suggesting the use of a single coherent spatial map. We found that place cells maintained their spatial offset in the cue conflict conditions, thus showing a robust spatial coupling featuring an attractor-like property in the CA1. These results indicate that reward features may control the place field orientation but may not cause sufficient input difference to create context-specific spatial maps in the CA1.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Why place fields demonstrate these characteristic phenomena during learning remains elusive. We develop a normative framework using a reward maximization objective, whereby the temporal difference (TD) error drives place field reorganization to improve policy learning. Place fields are modeled using Gaussian radial basis functions to represent states in an environment, and directly synapse to an actorcritic for policy learning. Each field’s amplitude, center, and width, as well as downstream weights, are updated online at each time step to maximize cumulative reward. We demonstrate that this framework unifies three disparate phenomena observed in navigation experiments. Furthermore, we show that these place field phenomena improve policy convergence when learning to navigate to a single target and relearning multiple new targets. To conclude, we develop a normative model that recapitulates several aspects of hippocampal place field learning dynamics and unifies mechanisms to offer testable predictions for future experiments.},

Accumulating research has revealed that computations of reward and its prediction occur on multiple levels across a complex set of interacting brain regions, including those that support memory and navigation. However, how the brain coordinates the encoding, recall and use of reward information to guide navigation remains incompletely understood. In this Review, we propose that the brain’s classical navigation centres — the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex — are ideally suited to coordinate this larger network by representing both physical and mental space as a series of states. These states may be linked to reward via neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus–entorhinal cortex system. Hippocampal outputs can then broadcast sequences of states to the rest of the brain to store reward associations or to facilitate decision-making, potentially engaging additional value signals downstream. This proposal is supported by recent advances in both experimental and theoretical neuroscience. By discussing the neural systems traditionally tied to navigation and reward at their intersection, we aim to offer an integrated framework for understanding navigation to reward as a fundamental feature of many cognitive processes.},

We studied whether types of hippocampal neural organization thought to underlie context discrimination is impacted by learned economic considerations of choice behavior. Hippocampal place cells and theta activity were recorded as rats performed a mazebased probability discounting task that involved choosing between a small certain reward or a large probabilistic reward. Different spatial distributions of place fields were observed in response to changes in probability, the outcome of the rats’ choice, and whether or not rats were free to make that choice. The degree to which the reward location was represented by place cells scaled with the expected probability of rewards. Theta power increased around the goal location also in proportion to the expected probability of signaled rewards. Further, theta power dynamically varied as specific econometric information was obtained ‘on the fly’ during task performance.

In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment1-5. However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity6. Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy.},

The activity of CA1 pyramidal cells was monitored as rats traversed a circular track that contained no objects in some conditions and 3-dimensial objects in other conditions. In the area of CA1 that receives direct lateral entorhinal input, three factors differentiated the objects-on-track conditions from the no-object conditions: more pyramidal cells expressed place fields when objects were present, adding or removing objects from the environment led to partial remapping in CA1, and the size of place fields decreased when objects were present. Additionally, a proportion of place fields remapped under conditions in which the object locations were shuffled, which suggests that at least some of the CA1 neurons’ firing patterns were sensitive to a particular object in a particular location. Together, these data suggest that the activity characteristics of neurons in the areas of CA1 receiving direct input from the perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices are modulated by non-spatial sensory input such as 3-dimensional objects.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal place cells support reward-related spatial memories by forming a cognitive map that over-represents reward locations. The strength of these memories is modulated by the extent of reward expectation during encoding. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying this modulation are unclear. Here we find that when reward expectation is extinguished in mice, they remain engaged with their environment, yet place cell over-representation of rewards vanishes, place field remapping throughout the environment increases, and place field trial-to-trial reliability decreases. Interestingly, Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) dopaminergic axons in CA1 exhibit a ramping reward-proximity signal that depends on reward expectation and inhibiting VTA dopaminergic neurons largely replicates the effects of extinguishing reward expectation. We conclude that changing reward expectation restructures CA1 cognitive maps and determines map reliability by modulating the dopaminergic VTA-CA1 reward-proximity signal. Thus, internal states of high reward expectation enhance encoding of spatial memories by reinforcing hippocampal cognitive maps associated with reward.},

We found that place cell activity was subject to an unexpected but precise homeostasis—the distribution of activity in the population as a whole being constant at all locations within and between environments. Using a virtual reconstruction of the largest environment, we showed that the rate of transition through this statistically stable population matches the rate of change in the animals’ visual scene. Thus, place ﬁelds near boundaries were small but numerous, while in the environment’s interior, they were larger but more dispersed.

In this study, we use a spatial cognition model to show that different field sizes could be exploited to adapt the place cell representation to different environments according to their size and complexity. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of how to distribute place cell fields according to the obstacles in cluttered environments to optimize learning time and path optimality during goal-oriented spatial navigation tasks. The analysis uses a reinforcement learning (RL) model that assumes that place cells allow encoding the state. While previous studies have suggested exploiting different field sizes to represent areas requiring different spatial resolutions, our work analyzes specific distributions that adapt the representation to the environment, activating larger fields in open areas and smaller fields near goals and subgoals (e.g., obstacle corners). In addition to assessing how the multi-scale representation may be exploited in spatial navigation tasks, our analysis and results suggest place cell representations that can impact the robotics field by reducing the total number of cells for path planning without compromising the quality of the paths learned.},

	abstract = {Changes in the spatial arrangement or identity of objects inside a familiar environment induce reexploration. The present study looks at modifications of place cell activity during such renewed exploration. Hungry rats foraged for food in a cylinder with a salient cue card attached to the wall and with two distinct objects at fixed positions on the floor relative to each other and to the cue card. Once a set of CA1 place cells was recorded in this standard configuration, additional sessions were done after two kinds of manipulation. In the first, the two objects were rotated as a rigid set 90 degrees counterclockwise around the cylinder center while leaving the cue card in place; this was considered a spatial change. The effects of rotating the objects were different for fields near the objects (near fields) and fields far from the objects (far fields). Object rotation altered most near fields in complex ways, including remapping and cessation of firing. Near fields that remained intact after object rotation underwent unpredictable rotations that frequently departed considerably from the expected value of 90 degrees CCW. In contrast, the only change induced in far fields was a reduction of discharge rate on day 1, but not day 2, exposures of the rat to the rotated objects. The effects on both near and far fields were reversed when the objects were returned to their standard position. In the second manipulation, substitution of one of the two familiar objects with a novel object, a nonspatial change, had no detectable effect on place cell activity, regardless of field location. The sensitivity of hippocampal place cells to spatial changes but not to nonspatial changes is in agreement with earlier results showing that hippocampal lesions abolish reexploration after spatial but not after nonspatial object manipulations. The fact that reexploration is accompanied by place cell changes after spatial but not nonspatial changes reinforces the role that the hippocampus is believed to play in navigational computing and is perfectly compatible with the idea that another brain structure, likely perirhinal cortex, is responsible for object recognition. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the present study, a new architecture for the generation of grid cells (GC) was implemented on a real robot. In order to test this model a simple place cell (PC) model merging visual PC activity and GC was developed. GC were first built from a simple “several to one” projection (similar to a modulo operation) performed on a neural field coding for path integration (PI). Robotics experiments raised several practical and theoretical issues. To limit the important angular drift of PI, head direction information was introduced in addition to the robot proprioceptive signal coming from the wheel rotation. Next, a simple associative learning between visual place cells and the neural field coding for the PI has been used to recalibrate the PI and to limit its drift. Finally, the parameters controlling the shape of the PC built from the GC have been studied. Increasing the number of GC obviously improves the shape of the resulting place field. Yet, other parameters such as the discretization factor of PI or the lateral interactions between GC can have an important impact on the place field quality and avoid the need of a very large number of GC. In conclusion, our results show our GC model based on the compression of PI is congruent with neurobiological studies made on rodent. GC firing patterns can be the result of a modulo transformation of PI information. We argue that such a transformation may be a general property of the connectivity from the cortex to the entorhinal cortex. Our model predicts that the effect of similar transformations on other kinds of sensory information (visual, tactile, auditory, etc…) in the entorhinal cortex should be observed. Consequently, a given EC cell should react to non-contiguous input configurations in non-spatial conditions according to the projection from its different inputs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although the properties of place cells are a basis for understanding the mammalian representation of spatial knowledge, there is no consensus on which of the two fundamental neural-coding hypotheses correctly accounts for how place cells encode spatial information. Within the dedicated-coding hypothesis, the current activity of each cell is an independent estimate of the location with respect to its place field. The average of the location estimates from many cells represents current location, so a dedicated place code would degrade if single cells had multiple place fields. Within the alternative, ensemble-coding hypothesis, the concurrent discharge of many place cells is a vector that represents current location. An ensemble place code is not degraded if single cells have multiple place fields as long as the discharge vector at each location is unique. Place cells with multiple place fields might be required to represent the substantially larger space in more natural environments. To distinguish between the dedicated-coding and ensemble-coding hypotheses, we compared the characteristics of CA1 place fields in a standard cylinder and an approximately six times larger chamber. Compared with the cylinder, in the chamber, more CA1 neurons were place cells, each with multiple, irregularly arranged, and enlarged place fields. The results indicate that multiple place fields is a fundamental feature of CA1 place cell activity and that, consequently, an ensemble place code is required for CA1 discharge to accurately signal location.},

The current study demonstrates a double dissociation between the shifts in the center of mass (COM) of the place fields that were simultaneously recorded in CA1 and CA3 when familiar cue configurations were dynamically changed over days. The COM of CA3 place fields shifted backward in the first experience of the cue-changed environment, whereas the COM of CA1 place fields did not display the backward shift until the next day. These results support the hypothesis that CA3 plays a key role in the rapid formation of representations of new spatiotemporal sequences, whereas CA1 may be more important for comparing currently experienced sequence information with stored sequences in the CA3 network.},

Models of cognitive mapping in neuroscience mostly depict map-learning as a process of random or biased diffusion. In practice, however, animals explore spaces using structured, purposeful, sensory-guided actions. Here we test the hypothesis that executing specific exploratory actions is a key strategy for building a cognitive map. Previous work has shown that in arenas with obstacles and a shelter, mice spontaneously learn efficient multi-step escape routes by memorizing allocentric subgoal locations. We thus used threat-evoked escape to probe the relationship between ethological exploratory behavior and allocentric spatial memory. Using closed-loop neural manipulations to interrupt running movements during exploration, we found that blocking runs targeting an obstacle edge abolished subgoal learning. In contrast, blocking other movements while sparing edge-directed runs had no effect on memorizing subgoals. Finally, spatial analyses suggest that the decision to use a subgoal during escape takes into account the mouse’s starting position relative to the layout of the environment. We conclude that mice use an action-driven learning process to identify subgoals and that these subgoals are then integrated into a map-based planning process. We suggest a conceptual framework for spatial learning that is compatible with the successor representation from reinforcement learning and sensorimotor enactivism from cognitive science.},

The existence of place cells has led to the proposal that they are part of an integrated neural system dedicated to spatial navigation, an idea supported by the discovery of strong relationships between place cell activity and spatial problem solving. To further understand such relationships, we examined the discharge of place cells recorded while rats solved a place navigation task. We report that, in addition to having widely distributed firing fields, place cells also discharge selectively while the hungry rat waits in an unmarked goal location to release a food pellet. Such firing is not duplicated in other locations outside the main firing field even when the rat's behavior is constrained to be extremely similar to the behavior at the goal. We therefore propose that place cells provide both a geometric representation of the current environment and a reflection of the rat's expectancy that it is located correctly at the goal. This on-line feedback about a critical aspect of navigational performance is proposed to be signaled by the synchronous activity of the large fraction of place cells active at the goal. In combination with other (prefrontal) cells that provide coarse encoding of goal location, hippocampal place cells may therefore participate in a neural network allowing the rat to plan accurate trajectories in space.},

	abstract = {To explore the plastic representation of information in spatially selective hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we made multiple single-unit recordings in rats trained to find a hidden platform at a constant location in a hippocampal-dependent annular watermaze task. Hippocampal pyramidal cells exhibited place-related firing in the watermaze. Place fields tended to accumulate near the platform, even in probe trials without immediate escape. The percentage of cells with peak activity around the hidden platform was more than twice the percentage firing in equally large areas elsewhere in the arena. The effect was independent of the actual position of the platform in the room frame. It was dissociable from ongoing motor behavior and was not related to linear or angular speed, swim direction, or variation in hippocampal theta activity. There was no accumulation of firing in any particular region in rats that were trained with a variable platform location. These training-dependent effects suggest that regions of particular behavioral significance may be over-represented in the hippocampal spatial map, even when these regions are completely unmarked.},

	abstract = {Objects and landmarks are crucial for guiding navigation and must be integrated into the cognitive map of space. Studies of object coding in the hippocampus have primarily focused on activity of single cells. Here, we record simultaneously from large numbers of hippocampal CA1 neurons to determine how the presence of a salient object in the environment alters single-neuron and neural-population activity of the area. The majority of the cells showed some change in their spatial firing patterns when the object was introduced. At the neural-population level, these changes were systematically organized according to the animal's distance from the object. This organization was widely distributed across the cell sample, suggesting that some features of cognitive maps-including object representation-are best understood as emergent properties of neural populations.},
