\subsection{Grid cell module}

A grid cell module $l$ of size $N^{\text{gc}}$ is identified by a set of positions defined over a square centered at the origin and size of $2$, such that $\{(x_{i}, y_{i})\;\vert\; i \in N^{\text{gc}}\;\land\;x_{i},y_{i}\in (-1, 1)\}$.
This local square space has boundary conditions for each dimensions, such that for instance when $x_{t} + s^{\text{gc}}_{l} \cdot v_{x} > 2$ then the position update is taken to the other side $x_{t+1} = x_{t} + s^{\text{gc}}_{l} \cdot v_{x} - 2$, where $s^{\text{gc}}_{l}$ is the scale of the velocity in the local space of module $l$ with respect to the real global agent velocity $v=\{v_{x}, v_{y}\}$.
When the module is initialized, the starting positions of its cells are uniformely distributed over the square forming a lattice.
When the agent is reset in a new position at the beginning of new trial, a displacement vector is applied to the last cells positions, such that the mapping between the module local space and the global environment is preserved.

The firing rate vector of each cell is determined with respect to a 2D Gaussian tuning curve centered at the origin at $(0,0)$, and it is calculated as $r_{i} = \exp\left(-\frac{x^{2}_{i} + y^{2}_{i}}{2\sigma^{\text{gc}}_{l}}\right)$ where $\sigma^{\text{gc}}_{l}$ is the width of the tuning curve for module $l$.
