# PCNN
Acronym for Place Cells Neural Network.

**Gist**
*an agent should have a machinery able to form a spatial representation of the input with the following features:*
- place cells encoding for (unique) *positions* in the input space 
- place cells should form quickly and *online*
*How?*
- rate neurons
- hebbian plasticity 
- background stimulation from internal theta oscillations 
- neuromodulation-dependant learning (dopamine)


---
*Branches*
- **main** 
- **cold** study of how to implement learning of non-hot encoded representations


---
*TODO*
- [ ] update unittests (it is a legit word fr) (*ie* about the new trajectory function) 
- [ ] more tailored unittests
