# PCNN
Acronym for Place Cells Neural Network.

### Gist
*an agent should have a machinery able to form a spatial representation of the input with the following features:*
- place cells encoding for (unique) *positions* in the input space 
- place cells should form quickly and *online*
*How?*
- rate neurons
- hebbian plasticity 
- background stimulation from internal theta oscillations 
- neuromodulation-dependant learning (dopamine)

### Branches 
- **main** 
- **cold** study of how to implement learning of non-hot encoded representations. _NB: only visible in the original repository for now_

##### Forks 
[BioAI_Oslo]
synched every time there is a push to the original repository.

---
### TODO
- [ ] update unittests (it is a legit word fr) (*ie* about the new trajectory function) 
- [ ] more tailored unittests
